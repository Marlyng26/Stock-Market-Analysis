        In this stock market analysis, a script was written to loop through numerous stocks for a year and output the following information: ticker symbol, yearly chnage from opening price at the start of the year to closing price at the end of the year, and total stock volume. Furthermore, a conditional formatting was set to highlight positive change in green and negative chnage in red.Lastly, the solution returned the stock with "Greatest % Increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest Total Volume".
